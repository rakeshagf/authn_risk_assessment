## Problem Statement:

**Goal**: The primary goal is to develop an authentication risk assessment system for a banking application(s) that can accurately classify customer login attempts as 'normal' or 'anomalous' (abnormal).

**Current Challenge**: Traditional authentication methods often rely on static authentication policies, which doesn't offer a great combination of user experience and security. The challenge includes managing the trade-off between false positives (legitimate users inconvenienced with multiple factors) and false negatives (missed security threats).

**Proposed Solution**: Leverage advanced machine learning models, including unsupervised techniques like Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM for anomaly detection, and supervised methods like Random Forest for classification. These models can analyze customer login event data (e.g., time of day, geographical location, device type) to identify patterns indicative of suspicious activity. 

**Potential Benefits**: This machine learning solution aims to enhance security and improving user experience for normal login events.
Automation of login anomaly detection also reduces the burden on security operations teams, allowing them to focus on investigating high-priority threats rather than sifting through vast amounts of data manually. 

## Model Outcomes or Predictions:
4.	Identify the type of learning (classification or regression) and specify the expected output of your selected model. Determine whether supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms will be used.

## Data Acquisition:
6.	The deliverable at this step is to identify what data you plan to acquire and use with your model. For the best results, data should come from multiple sources and your analysis for including specific data should be clear. Please provide a clear visualization to assess the data’s potential to solve the problem as well.

## Data Preprocessing/Preparation: 
For this deliverable, you are tasked with detailing how you cleaned the data for your notebook. 
a.	What techniques did you use to ensure your data was free of missing values, and inconsistencies? 
b.	How did you split the data into training and test sets?
c.	Please include any necessary analysis and encoding steps you took as well.

## Modeling: 
For this deliverable, please document your selection of machine learning algorithms that you selected for your problem statement from the first deliverable.

## Model Evaluation: 
Share your model evaluation here. What types of models did you consider for your problem (classification, regression, unsupervised)?  Articulate the evaluation metrics you used and how you determined which model was most optimal for your problem.
